h1. Com Connect

A Textpattern CMS form mailer plugin. @<txp:com_connect />@ produces a flexible, customisable email contact form. It is intended for use as an enquiry form for commercial and private sites, and includes several features to help reduce common problems with such forms (invalid email addresses, missing information).

Please report bugs and problems with this plugin at "the GitHub project's issues page":https://github.com/textpattern/com_connect/issues.

h2(#features). Features

* Arbitrary HTML5 text fields can be specified, with min/max/required settings for validation.
* Email address validation, including a check for a valid MX record (Unix only).
* Safe escaping of input data.
* UTF-8 safe.
* Accessible form layout, including @<label>@, @<legend>@ and @<fieldset>@ tags.
* Various classes and ids to allow easy styling of all parts of the form.
* Spam prevention API (used by Tranquillo's @pap_contact_cleaner@ plugin) and delivery API for altering or extending the plugin's capabilities.

h2(#install). Installing and upgrading

*Requires Textpattern 4.5.0+*

Download the latest release of the plugin from "the GitHub project page":https://github.com/textpattern/com_connect/releases, paste the code into the Textpattern Admin → Plugins panel, install and enable the plugin. Visit the "forum thread":https://forum.textpattern.io/viewtopic.php?id=47913 for more info or to report on the success or otherwise of the plugin.

To uninstall, delete from the Admin → Plugins panel.

Alternatively, this plugin can be installed using "Composer":https://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer require textpattern/com_connect:*

h2(#differences). Differences from previous version

If upgrading from v4.0.3.20, please note these differences:

* Disable or remove the com_connect_lang plugin. Language strings are now bundled as part of the plugin itself. If you have a translation Textpack available that is not yet bundled, please submit it for inclusion.
* Classes based on the input element @name@ are no longer automatically applied. Only default class names beginning with @com@ are set. To employ custom classes, use the @class@ attribute for each tag, or the global @classes@ attribute to set names for error and information messages.
* If your site's Doctype preference is set to @html5@ you may use HTML5 attributes in your tags. Otherwise, they will be ignored.
* Validation of required elements and min/max constraints is done by the browser first, and the plugin second. So if you specify a field is required and it is left empty, the browser will usually prevent the form being submitted. To bypass (most of) the browser checks, specify @browser_validate="0"@ in your @<txp:com_connect />@ tag.

h2(#usage). Usage

h3. Contact form

The simplest form is shown below, which produces a default form with 'Name', 'Email' and 'Message' fields. Email will be delivered to <code>recipient@example.com</code>, with the user's supplied email as the @From:@ address.

bc. <txp:com_connect to="recipient@example.com" />

To specify fields explicitly, use something like this:

bc. <txp:com_connect to="recipient@example.com">
    <txp:com_connect_email />
    <txp:com_connect_text label="Phone" min="7" max="15" />
    <txp:com_connect_textarea label="Your question" />
    <txp:com_connect_submit label="Send" />
</txp:com_connect>

Alternatively, place the field specifications in a Textpattern form, and call it like this:

bc. <txp:com_connect to="recipient@example.com" form="my-contact-form" />

h3. Send article

Within the context of an individual article, this plugin can be used to send the article (or excerpt, if it exists) to an email address specified by the visitor. This requires at least two tags:

# @com_connect@, to create form that is initially hidden by setting the @send_article@ attribute.
# @com_connect_send_article@, to create a 'Send article' link which reveals the aforementioned form when clicked.

bc. <txp:com_connect send_article="1" />
<txp:com_connect_send_article />

By default the form contains fields for your name and email address, the recipient's email address and a personal message, but similar to contact forms you can create your own form layout. Some things you need to know:

# Set the @send_article@ attribute to @1@ in the @com_connect@ tag.
# Use a @com_connect_email@ tag with the @send_article@ attribute set to @1@. This field will be used as the recipient email address.

bc.. <txp:com_connect to="you@example.com" send_article="1">
    <txp:com_connect_email label="Recipient Email" send_article="1" />
    <txp:com_connect_email label="Your Email" />
    <txp:com_connect_submit label="Send Article" />
</txp:com_connect>

<txp:com_connect_send_article />

h2(#tags). Tags

@<txp:com_connect_send_article />@ can be used to create a 'Send article' link within an article form, connecting it to the contact form.

All other tags provided by this plugin can only be used inside a @<txp:com_connect>@ - @</txp:com_connect>@ container tag or in a Textpattern form used as the @form@ attribute in the @<txp:com_connect />@ tag.

In addition to the tags detailed in the following sections, every tag accepts a core set of common attributes. These are:

* @accesskey="character"@<br />Shortcut key to set focus on the field.
* @autofocus="boolean"@<br />To automatically focus the cursor in this field on page load. Only one field may have this property.
* @dir="value"@<br />Text direction (@ltr@, @rtl@ or @auto@).
* @disabled="boolean"@<br />Whether the input control accepts user input. If set, the element does not get submitted with the form, nor is it subject to any @checkValidity()@ JavaScript calls.
* @hidden="boolean"@<br />The visibility of the input control.
* @id="id"@<br />The HTML identifier for the control.
* @lang="value"@<br />The ISO 639 language short code (e.g. @en-gb@, @de-de@) that govern the field.
* @list="id"@<br />Used in conjunction with the @<datalist>@ tag to specify a set of options. The id is the reference to the datalist to use.
* @readonly="boolean"@<br />Control does not accept user input, but will be processed on form submission and can be validated.
* @spellcheck="value"@<br />Whether the field is subject to spell checking (@true@ = yes, @default@ = browser decides, or @false@ = no).
* @style="style rules"@<br />Inline CSS @style@ rules to apply to the input control.
* @tabindex="number"@<br />The order in which the cursor jumps between elements when using the tab key.
* @title="value"@<br />Usually used for hover tooltip describing the input control's use in your application.
* @translate="boolean"@<br />Whether to subject the attribute content to language translation.

h3(#cc). com_connect tag

bc. <txp:com_connect />

May be used as a single (self-closing) or container tag. Place this where you want the input form to go. Status and error messages, if any, will be displayed before the form.

h4. Attributes

* @body_form="form name"@<br />Use specified form for the message body text.
* @class="space-separated values"@<br />Set the CSS @class@ name of the tag. Default: @comConnectForm@. To remove @class@ attribute from the element entirely, use @class=""@.
* @classes="comma-separated key:value pairs"@<br />Set the CSS classes for error / information conditions. Specify each as a pair of values separated by a colon, e.g. @classes="required: req_field, element: warn_field"@. There are up to four available to customise:
** @element@: Set for each form field that fails validation for any reason. Default: @errorElement@.
** @wrapper@: The class to surround the list of errors shown above the form. Default: @comError@.
** @required@: Class assigned when a required element is not completed. Default: @comRequired@.
** @thanks@: Class applied to the wrapper around the @thanks_form@. Default: @comThanks@.
* @copysender="boolean"@<br />Whether to send a copy of the email to the sender's address. Available values: @1@ (yes) or @0@ (no). Default is @0@.
* @expire="number"@<br />Number of seconds after which the form will expire, thus requiring a page refresh before sending. Default is @600@.
* @form="form name"@<br />Use specified form, containing the layout of the contact form fields.
* @from="email address"@<br />Email address used in the "From:" field when sending email. Defaults to the sender's email address. If specified, the sender's email address will be placed in the "Reply-To:" field instead.

h2(#advanced). Advanced examples

h3(#advanced1). Separate input and error forms

Using @show_input@ and @show_error@ to display the form and error messages on different parts of a page. A form is used to make sure the contents of both forms are identical, otherwise they would be seen as two independent forms. The first form only shows errors (no input), the second form only shows the input fields (no errors).

bc. <div id="error">
    <txp:com_connect form="contact_form" show_input="0" />
</div>
<div id="inputform">
    <txp:com_connect form="contact_form" show_error="0" />
</div>

Apart from the @show_error@ and @show_input@ attributes, all other attributes must be 100% identical in both forms, otherwise they would be seen as two unrelated forms.

h3(#advanced2). User selectable subject field

Specify the @subject_form@ attribute and create a form which includes a @com_connect_select@ tag:

bc. <txp:com_connect to="you@example.com" subject_form="my_subject_form" />
    <txp:com_connect_text label="Name" /><br />
    <txp:com_connect_email /><br />
    <txp:com_connect_select label="Choose Subject" options=",Question,Feedback" /><br />
    <txp:com_connect_textarea label="Message" /><br />
</txp:com_connect>

Create a Textpattern form called "my_subject_form", containing:

bc. <txp:php>
    global $com_connect_form;
    echo $com_connect_form['Choose Subject'];
</txp:php>

The @label@ used in the @com_connect_select@ tag must be identical to the corresponding variable in the @subject_form@. Here we used @Choose subject@.

If you'd prefer to add a common prefix for all subjects, use a @subject_form@ containing:

bc. <txp:php>
    global $com_connect_form;
    echo 'My common prefix - ' . $com_connect_form['Choose Subject'];
</txp:php>

h3(#advanced3). User selectable recipient, without showing email address

Specify the @to_form@ attribute and create a form which includes a @com_connect_select@ tag:

bc. <txp:com_connect to_form="my_com_connect_to_form">
    <txp:com_connect_text label="Name" /><br />
    <txp:com_connect_email /><br />
    <txp:com_connect_select label="Department" options=",Support,Sales" /><br />
    <txp:com_connect_textarea label="Message" /><br />
</txp:com_connect>

Create a Textpattern form called "my_com_connect_to_form", containing:

bc. <txp:php>
    global $com_connect_form;
    switch($com_connect_form['Department'])
    {
        case 'Support':
            echo 'crew@example.com';
            break;
        case 'Sales':
            echo 'showmethemoney@example.com';
            break;
        default:
            echo 'someone@example.com';
    }
</txp:php>

The @label@ used in the @com_connect_select@ tag must be identical to the corresponsing variable in the @to_form@. Here we used @Department@.

A 'default' email address in the @to_form@ is specified to ensure that a valid email address is used in cases where you add or change a select/radio option and forget to update the @to_form@.

p(alert-block warning). *Warning:* Never use tags like @com_connect_text@, @com_connect_email@ or @com_connect_textarea@ for setting the recipient address, otherwise your form can be abused to send spam to any email address!

h2(#styling). Styling

The form itself has a @class@ of @comConnectForm@ set on the @form@ HTML tag.

The list of error messages (if any) has a @class@ of @comError@ set on the @ul@ HTML tag that encloses the list of errors. This class name may be overridden using the @classes@ attribute of the @com_connect@ tag.

All form elements and corresponding labels have the following classes (or ids set by default):

# One of @comText@, @comEmail@, @comTextarea@, @comSelect@, @comOption@, @comRadio@, @comCheckbox@ or @comSubmit@. By default, it should be obvious which @class@ is used for which form element (and corresponding label). You can override these names by using your own @class@ attribute.
# @comRequired@ and/or @errorElement@, depending on whether the form element is required, an error was found in whatever the visitor entered, or both. These can be overriden using the @classes@ attribute on the @com_connect@ tag.
# An individual @id@ or @class@ set to the value of the @name@ attribute of the corresponding tag. When styling forms based on this @class@, you should explicitly set the @name@ attribute because automatically generated names may change in newer com_connect versions.

h2(#api). Com Connect's API

The plugin API of com_connect, originally developed by Tranquillo, allows other plugins to interact with contact forms. This permits extra functionality such as combatting comment cpam, HTML email, newsletter delivery and so forth to be bolted onto the base plugin.

Four callback events exist in com_connect:

* @comconnect.submit@ is called after the form is submitted and the values are checked if empty or valid email addresses, but before the mail is sent.
* @comconnect.form@ lets you inject content (fields) in the contact form as displayed to the visitor.
* @comconnect.render@ lets you inject or alter markup of the entire @<form>@. Useful for editing things like @enctype@ (e.g. for file attachment modules that link into this plugin).
* @comconnect.deliver@ is called immediately prior to delivery and advertises the intended payload so you may manipulate it. For example, you could do something as simple as adding CC: or BCC: fields. Or change the MIME type header to @text/html@ and add some HTML content based on the given body data, then let com_connect handle the mailing. Or you could intercept the entire mail process, handle mailing yourself with a third party system, and tell com_connect to skip its internal mailing process.

For reference here are the commands that will be interesting to plugin developers:

bc.. // This will call your function before the form is submitted so you can analyse the submitted data
register_callback('abc_myfunction', 'comconnect.submit');

// This will call your function and add the output (use @return $mystuff;@) to the contact-form.
register_callback('abc_myotherfunction2', 'comconnect.form');

// To get hold of the form-variables you can use global com_connect_form;
// With the following two lines you can tell com_connect if your plugin found spam.
$evaluator =& get_comconnect_evaluator();

// The passed value must be non-zero to mark the content as spam.
// Value must be a number between 0 and 1.
$evaluator -> add_comconnect_status(1);

p. Multiple plugins can be active at the same time and each of them can mark the submitted content as spam and prevent the form from being submitted.

h4. Examples

bc.. register_callback('pap_comconnect_form','comconnect.form');
register_callback('pap_comconnect_submit','comconnect.submit');

function pap_comconnect_form()
{
    $field = '<div style="display:none">'.
        finput('text','phone',ps('phone'),'','','','','','phone').'<br />'.
        finput('text','mail',ps('mail'),'','','','','','mail').'</div>';
    return $field;</code>
}

function pap_comconnect_submit()
{
    $checking_mail_field = trim(ps('mail'));
    $checking_phone_field = trim(ps('phone'));
    $evaluation =& get_comconnect_evaluator();

    // If the hidden fields are filled out, the contact form won't be submitted!
    if ($checking_mail_field != '' or $checking_phone_field != '') {
        $evaluation -> add_comconnect_status(1);
    }

    return;
}

p. For the delivery callback, you signal back to the plugin your intentions so that Com Connect knows what to do after your delivery plugin has executed. Return the following strings:

* @comconnect.send@ (or no return value) to allow Com Connect to continue mailing the content.
* @comconnect.skip@ to skip com_connect's mailing (i.e., the third party handles the mail process) and return 'success' to the visitor.
* @comconnect.fail@ to skip com_connect's mailing and return 'fail' to the visitor.

Or simply @exit@ your plugin to halt the entire operation so no Com Connect feedback is given.

h2. Frequently asked questions

h5. How do I remove the legend and fieldset surrounding the contact form?

Set the @label@ attribute to an empty value (@label=""@) in the @com_connect@ tag.

h5. No email is sent. How do I diagnose and fix the problem?

First try a simple contact form, using only the @com_connect@ tag with the @to@ attribute set to a valid email address. If that doesn't send email, fill out the 'SMTP envelope sender address' field in Textpattern's Admin → Preferences panel on the admin tab. If that doesn't help either, take a look at your mail server log files to see what the problem is.

h5. Which tag do I use to create the submit button?

Just use normal HTML code to create a submit button. For historical reasons this plugin still provides the @com_connect_submit@ tag, but it provides little extra functionality.

h5. How can I get a unique (order) number in the subject of each email?

Try using the "rvm_counter":http://vanmelick.com/txp tag in the @subject@ attribute of the @com_connect@ tag.

h5. I want to use the contact form in an article list (one form for each article), but how do I make each form unique?

You can make each form unique by making one of its attribute values unique. See previous question for an example of how to do this with the @subject@ attribute.

h5. Send article: can I let people specify multiple recipients?

No. The 'send article' functionality is spammy enough as it is right now.

h5. Send article: can I show the contact form without having to click a link first?

Sure, put this just above the @com_connect@ tag:

bc. <txp:php>$_GET['com_connect_send_article']='yes';</txp:php>

h5. How can I use this form to upload files?

You can't, but have a look at the "ext_file_attach":https://github.com/Bloke/ext_file_attach/releases/ module, or "mem_form":https://bitbucket.org/Manfre/txp-plugins/downloads/ plugins.

h5. Can I use this plugin to send HTML email?

Not without a plugin like "mem_form":https://bitbucket.org/Manfre/txp-plugins/downloads or using the delivery callback.

h5. Can I use this plugin to send newsletters?

Not without a plugin, such as "mem_postmaster":https://bitbucket.org/Manfre/txp-plugins/downloads/.

h5. I have a question that's not listed here

First read the plugin documentation (the page you're on right now) once more. If that doesn't answer your question, visit the "Textpattern forum":https://forum.textpattern.io.

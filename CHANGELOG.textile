h2. 0.08 - 2006-01-23

* New attribute @copysender@ added. When set to @yes@ a copy of the email will be sent to the sender's email address as well as your own (thanks to Anura for explaining 'concatenation').

h2. 0.07 - 2006-01-17

* Error messages are output as a @<ul>@ so I have given the @<ul>@ tag a @class="zemError"@. Now you can style the messages.
* When @required="yes"@, labels will have a second @class@ added to them in the form @class="zemRequired $name"@ so that you can set an overall style for @required@ labels as well as make individual adjustments where necessary. Where @required="no"@, labels will continue to use @class="$name"@.
* When @required="yes"@, a class=“zemRequired” is also added to the “input” so that you can style those in a different manner as well if you wish.

They can also add an extra message if they wish. The article's title and body will be included in the email automatically.
* Help text updated.
